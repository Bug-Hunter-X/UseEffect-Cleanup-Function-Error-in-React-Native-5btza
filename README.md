This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function throws an error after the component has unmounted. The solution involves adding a mounted flag to ensure the component is still mounted before accessing its state or props.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.
